#Overview
A C++ game that combines Snakes & Ladders with Monopoly, featuring a 9x11 grid where 4 players compete to reach the final cell while managing coins, encountering snakes, ladders, and special cards. The game includes two modes: Design Mode for creating and editing game boards with various objects (snakes, ladders, and 9 types of cards), and Play Mode where players roll dice, move across the board, and interact with game objects using an object-oriented architecture and GUI implementation.
